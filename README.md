# victoramanze-Simple-Linear-Regression-with-python-and-checking-model-assumptions
Now we will begin diving into regression analysis and this is the first simple linear regression project which identifies standards model assumption will be met to fit a model.
Throughout the following exercises, you will learn to use Python to build a simple linear regression model. Before starting on this programming exercise

As we move forward, you can find instructions on how to install required libraries as they arise in this notebook. Before we begin with the exercises and analyzing the data, we need to import all libraries and extensions required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will
Before you construct any model, it is important to get more familiar with your data. You can do so by performing exploratory data analysis or EDA. Please review previous program materials as needed if you would like to re-familiarize yourself with EDA concepts.

Since this part of the course focuses on simple linear regression, you want to check for any linear relationships among variables in the dataframe. You can do this by creating scatterplots using any data visualization package, for example matplotlib.plt, seaborn, or plotly.
